# Augmented Reality Tone Visualization
This is an augmented reality application for Android built using C# designed to have the user match a 220 Hz tone. To do so, the app visualizes the difference between the voice of the user and the 220 Hz tone using the Argand plane. The changing colors are based on Steve Mann's theory on colors mapped onto an Argand plane. Requires an augmented reality headset for the full experience.
