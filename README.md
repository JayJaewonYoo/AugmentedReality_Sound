# Augmented Reality Tone Visualization
This is an augmented reality application for Android designed to have the user match a 220 Hz tone. To do so, the app visualizes the difference between the voice of the user and the 220 Hz tone using the Argand plane. The changing colors are based on Steve Mann's theory on colors mapped onto an Argand plane. Requires an augmented reality headset for the full experience.

## Installation
Download the .apk file in the repository found under release directly through the Android phone.

## Notes
- The application gains latency issues when the user attempts to use the application again after locking the phone screen but leaving the application on. After locking the phone screen, close and open the application. 
- This application was built by Jay Jaewon Yoo for Steve Mann's "Mersivity" project. 
- The source code for this app will not be made public due to its potential applications in business ventures with Steve Mann.
